## Version 1.10

- Added workaround for CompactRaidFrame* taint.

NOTE: **IMPORTANT!** Now there's no ls: Toasts entry in Interface > AddOns section, but you'll create one on the first use of **/lstoasts** command. After that you'll be able to access config panel the old way. However, I strongly recommend to /reload UI after you're done setting up the addon. Even if you opened and closed config panel without changing anything, /reload UI. By doing so, you'll remove config entry from the system and prevent possible taints. Blame Blizzard, not me.
