# CHANGELOG

## Version 100206.01

- Added 10.2.6 support.

## Version 100205.03

### Loot (Special)

- Added loot roll info. It's a returning feature. However, there's a caveat, I don't know if "transmog" rolls are
  actually a thing in this particular case because it's basically an undocumented feature. I added it based on my
  assumptions, so if it works, good, if it doesn't, oh well. But "need", "greed", and "disenchant" rolls should work as
  expected.

## Version 100205.02

- Added partial Brazilian Portuguese translation. Translated by paulovnas@GitHub.

## Version 100205.01

- Added 10.2.5 support.

## Version 100200.01

- Added 10.2 support.
- Added "LS: Toasts" entry to the addon compartment in the top right corner of the minimap.
- Tweaked toast borders so that the texture looks more consistent with no warping or shifting.
  Doesn't affect ElvUI skins.

### Transmogrification

- Fixed an issue where sometimes a toast wouldn't show up. It's primarily affecting "Quantum Items" that unlock
  a random appearance on use.

## Version 100105.01

- Added 10.1.5 support.

## Version 100100.03

- Added "Two Tone" variants to all built-in skins. They have a two tone background that's similar to that of Blizz
  achievement toasts. I might tweak the textures depending on the feedback.
- Updated Spanish translation. Translated by Shacoulrophobia@Curse.

## Version 100100.02

- Fixed world quest toasts.

## Version 100100.01

- Added 10.1.0 support.

## Version 100007.01

- Added 10.0.7 support.

## Version 100005.03

- Added "Traveler's Log" toasts for monthly activities.

### Loot (Currency)

- Added support for Trader's Tenders. They might be buggy due to how they're implemented on Blizz end. Unlike other
  currencies these update reliably only when the Trading Post UI is shown, that's why if you gain them while you're away
  from the Trading Post you may or may not get the toast.

## Version 100005.02

### Loot (Common)

- Reworked the reagent and crafted item quality icon.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oZomyJR.png)

## Version 100005.01

- Added 10.0.5 support.

### Loot (Common)

## Version 100002.02

- Updated French translation. Translated by agstegiel@Curse and Braincell1980@Curse.
- Updated German translation. Translated by MrKimab@Curse.

## Version 100002.01

- Added 10.0.2 support.
- Fixed an issue where the addon would load the achievement UI too early which in turn could cause
  errors.

## Version 100000.03

- Fixed file loading order.

## Version 100000.02

- Added an option to show poor quality quality items via common loot toasts. Thanks to Faqar@GitHub.
- Added leaf ornaments to achievement toasts. I can't re-enable Blizz achievement toasts, so as a
  compromise I chose to make achievement toasts more unique. If you want them to stand out even more
  create a separate anchor to display them.
- Fixed an issue where repeatedly testing toasts and flushing the queue would sometimes lock up the
  addon.
- Fixed corrupt beautycase border texture. It worked, but baked-in shadows were messed up.
- Updated Traditional Chinese translation. Translated by BNS333@Curse.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/yqJ7C6S.png)

## Version 100000.01

- Added 10.0.0 support;
- Added new "Info" panel to the config. It has links to various resourced including my Discord
  server dedicated to LS: * addons;
- Renamed "Recipe" toasts to "Profession". Added profession skill line toasts;
- Updated "Collection" toasts;
- Updated embeds.

## Version 90207.01

- Added 9.2.7 support;
- Fixed an issue where archaeology toasts would show the loss of fragments;

- Added 9.1.5 support.

## Version 90100.03

  more info with hotfixes, so this most likely isn't the last spam fix. 

## Version 90100.02

- Fixed "Torghast - Scoreboard" toast spam.

## Version 90100.01

- Added 9.1.0 support.

## Version 90005.01

- Added 9.0.5 support.

## Version 90002.01

- Added 9.0.2 support.

## Version 90001.04

- Added Italian translation. Translated by vabatta@GitHub;
- Updated Korean translation. Translated by unrealcrom96@Curse;
- Updated Traditional Chinese translation. Translated by RainbowUI@Curse.

## Version 90001.03

- Added currency toast filters. They will allow you to blacklist certain currencies entirely and
  to set thresholds below which toasts won't be generated. The addon will try to populate the
  currency list with discovered currencies automatically, thus you should log in on a character
  that discovered them most currencies at least once, but there's a way to add currency IDs
  manually. Out of the box, the only active currency filter is for `"Honor"`, it's set to 25; 
- Updated Traditional Chinese translation. Translated by RainbowUI@Curse.

![](https://i.imgur.com/zpXx0KW.png)

## Version 90001.02

- Added support for runecarving toasts which become available later after SL launch;
- Added honour throttling for currency toasts. For the time being any honour gains below 20
  will be ignored to avoid any toast spam in BGs. It's a temporary measure, I'll replace it
  with proper currency filtering later.

## Version 90001.01

NOTE: You'll have to restart WoW client to make things work after the update.

## Version 80205.01

- Added 8.2.5 support;
- Moved all Blizz store-related toasts to their own group: Shop. Revamped Recruit-a-Friend rewards
  will be handled by this group as well;
- Misc bug fixes and tweaks.

## Version 80200.06

- Fixed "Artifact Fragment" currency spam in Ashran. If you encounter similar issues in the future  
  feel free to report them. There's a number of unusual currencies in the game that behave  
  differently from others, so manual adjustments are needed to handle them properly.

## Version 80200.05

- Colour texts that indicate some sort of loss, i.e., "You Lost", "Appearance Removed", red;
- Updated Simplified Chinese translation. Translated by vk1103ing@Curse;

  threshold. Disabled by default;
- Updated German translation. Translated by Merathilis@Curse;
- Updated Korean translation. Translated by netaras@Curse;
- Updated Spanish translations. Translated by Gotxiko@Curse;
- Updated Traditional Chinese translation. Translated by BNS333@Curse.

  because it's interfering with the new functionality;
- Updated embeds.

## Version 80200.01

- Added 8.2.0 support;
- Added Ctrl-Left-Click support to transmog, toy, mount, and item toasts to show the dressing room
  frame;
- Updated embeds.

## Version 80100.10

- Added "ToastCreated", "ToastSpawned", and "ToastReleased" callbacks. As always, callbacks use  
  CallbackHandler-1.0;
- Renamed toasts' Recycle method to Release. Recycle is still available, but is deprecated;
- Renamed "SetSkin" and "ResetSkin" callbacks to "SkinSet" and "SkinReset". "SetSkin" and  
  "ResetSkin" are still available, but are deprecated;
- Fixed toasts' border's tiling;
- Updated embeds.

## Version 80100.09

- Updated Traditional Chinese translation. Translated by BNSSNB@Curse;
- Updated embeds.

## Version 80100.04

- Added "SetSkin" and "ResetSkin" callbacks. Use these if you hooked my ApplySkin method to modify toasts'  
  appearance since ApplySkin no longer exists. Callbacks use CallbackHandler-1.0, so something like  
  `ls_Toasts[1].RegisterCallback({}, "SetSkin", function(callbackName, toast) end)` should do the trick;
- Updated Traditional Chinese translation. Translated by BNSSNB@Curse;
- Misc performance and memory optimisations.

## Version 80100.03

- Added support for multiple toast anchors. Each anchor has its own growth, scale, and other  
  settings;
- Added options to adjust toast growth offsets.

## Version 80100.02

- Improved compatibility with addons that modify chat messages which are used by common loot and  
  currency toasts.

## Version 80100.01

- Added 8.1.0 support;
- Slightly reorganised in-game config;
- Fixed common loot toasts. Items created via professions and scrapping should be handled  
  correctly once again.

## Version 80000.06

- Added "Default (Legacy)" and "ElvUI (Legacy)" skins that use old texture backgrounds;

  redraw some of them in higher resolution;

- Updated German translation. Translated by pas06@Curse.

## Version 70300.04

- Removed click handler from collection toasts. It taints Blizz code too much;
- Updated Korean translation. Translated by yuk6196@Curse;
- Updated Simplified Chinese translation. Translated by y368413@Curse;
- Updated Traditional Chinese translation. Translated by gaspy10@Curse.

- Added countermeasures to limit bloat caused by transmog toasts.

## Version 70200.04

- Fixed bonus roll toast issues.

## Version 70200.03

## Version 1.24

- Added "ls: Toasts" config entry w/ "Enable" button to interface options panel. However, It doesn't change the fact that you still need to reload UI after you're done setting up the addon, hence I also added "Reload UI" button;
- Disabled common loot and currency string checks. Hopefully new patterns will perform better, but if I start getting reports about party/raid member loot toasts again, I'll re-enable them;
- Changed addon name's colour so it'll no longer interfere w/ addon list sorting;
- Updated Korean translation. Translated by yuk6196@Curse;
- Updated German translation. Translated by pas06@Curse;
- Numerous bug fixes and tweaks.

## Version 1.23

- First attempt to address issue that made some people receive party/raid members' loot toasts. As of this version if addon detects that necessary variables were modified by another addon, it'll disable common loot and/or currency toasts, you'll be able to see which variables were modified and what addon did it in in-game config. Addon will also start checking if `CHAT_MSG_LOOT`'s 5th param (target) is the same as player's name;
- Updated German translation. Translated by pas06@Curse.

NOTE: Warning preview. !test is my test addon.

## Version 1.22

- Fixed in-game config.

## Version 1.21

- Reworked profile manager. Sadly, I had to reset all settings;
- Added public methods to create, delete, set, and reset profiles. This feature is for addon devs. For more info, read [here](https://github.com/ls-/ls_Toasts#how-to-mod);
- Removed config from global `ls_Toasts` table;
- Updated German translation. Translated by Ithilrandir@Curse.

- Added 7.1 support;

## Version 1.13

- Added hook to prevent default notifications from being shown;
- Added comparison tooltip to item toasts. Hold "Shift" key to show it. Original code by p3lim@GitHub.

## Version 1.12

- Added currency toast stacking. Instead of creating new toasts for each currency gain, existing one will be updated;
- Added skinning support. This feature is for addon devs. For more info, read [here](https://github.com/ls-/ls_Toasts#how-to-reskin).

## Version 1.11

- Fixed handling of caged battle pets.

## Version 1.10

- Added workaround for few taints.

NOTE: **IMPORTANT!** Now there's no ls: Toasts entry in Interface > AddOns section, but you can create one by using **/lstoasts** command. After that you'll be able to access config panel the old way. However, I strongly recommend to **/reload** UI after you're done setting up the addon. Even if you opened and closed config panel without changing anything, **/reload UI**. By doing so, you'll remove config entry from the system and prevent possible taints. Blame Blizzard, not me.

## Version 1.09

- Split "Garrison" toast group into two new groups: "Garrison" and "Class Hall";
- Moved currency toasts to a new category, "Loot (Currency)";

## Version 1.02

- Fixed issue in garrison toast test.

## Version 1.01

- Release released.
