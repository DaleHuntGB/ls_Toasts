## Download
- [WoWInterface](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24123.html)
- [Curse](http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/ls-toasts)

## Features
- One design for all toasts. Special alert frames have unique backgrounds;
- In-game config. Use **/lstoasts** command to open config panel. From there you can disable sounds, move alert frames, etc;
- DND mode. You can enable DND mode for different toast groups. Toasts in DND mode won't be displayed in combat, but will be queued up in the system. Once you leave combat, they'll start popping up. Available from in-game config;

## Usage
- Install it;
- _(Optional)_ Configure it;
- Done.

**Note #1:** By default, there's no ls: Toasts entry in Interface > AddOns section. You can create one by using **/lstoasts** command. It's a workaround for infamous CompactRaidFrame* taint, and few others. It's a really old Blizz bug, and I don't think it'll ever be fixed.

I strongly recommend to **/reload** UI after you're done setting up the addon. Even if you opened and closed config panel without changing anything, **/reload** UI. By doing so, you'll remove config entry from the system and prevent possible taints.
